# PRODIGY_ML_01
A linear Regression model which predicts housing prices from a region (Here-California).<br> 
<br>
Greeting Everyone !!. This project was done as a part of my internship Tasks from PRODIGYINFOTECH.<br> <br> Here i've implemented a linear Regression model which takes Parameters from the Dataset and use it to compute the results.<br>
<br>
The DataSet used here is taken from kaggle using Kaggle API and the code is ran in Google COLAB .<br>
<br>
For those who trying to run this there colab , First upload your kaggle-api-token (A json file named - kaggle.json) and then run the code.<br>
<br>
#### Steps involved were :- 
1) Get the dataset,
2) Drop incomplete or Unwanted Data from the Data set(Done using analysing Co-relation matrix),
3) Engineer some additional features,
4) Make Train_Test_Split ,
5) Fit the training Data ,
6) Get the Accuracy from Fitting the Test Data
